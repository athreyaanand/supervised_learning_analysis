# A Deep Dive into Supervised Learning

For this deepdive, 5 supervised-learning algorithms were tested and analyzed across two different datasets. Each folder (fashion and letter) contains a data set, the 5 algorithms with their own individual python (2.7) script, and a directory of images produced by the afore mentioned scripts.

To run these scripts yourself, make sure you have the following python dependencies installed: matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, numpy. Once installed simply call 'python <filename>' in the specific directory and watch the magic happen!
